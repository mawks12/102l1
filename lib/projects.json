They were an exciting project to help work on as they combined arduino, 3d printing, wiring, and timings to create something which hopefully will inspire a younger generation of scientists! I contributed all of the code managing LED timings and sequences on the microcontroller, which can be found on the project Github Page.\n                ",

Though incomplete, it has already been a fun project to try. The current code for it can be found on it's Github Page.\n                ",

Above is an example of the current preprocessing pipeline we use to smooth and amplify potential seamounts. For more information on this type of work, see our Website.\n                ",
